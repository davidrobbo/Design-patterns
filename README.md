# Design-patterns
To anyone who may come across this repository, I am a full stack web developer most comfortable at the time of writing this with PHP/Laravel and JS/Vue JS. I have made a few native Android apps and enjoy working with Java, but my current role means I only get the chance to use Java in my own time.

This repository is for my own personal learning to help up-skill with both Java and Design patterns. If you happen to find anything useful, or you spot anything that you think would help my learning, then drop me a message.
